                  <p class="card-text">Aquaponics is a method of food production that combines aquaculture; 
                    the cultivation of aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp, crayfish, or prawns, in tanks and hydroponics; 
                    the growing of plants in water.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The fish and plants are cultivated together in a recirculating ecosystem that utilizes 
                    natural nitrogen-fixing bacteria to convert fish/aquatic animal wastes into plant nutrients. 
                    The waste products of the aquaculture system serve as nutrients for the hydroponic system. 
                    With such a combined recirculating system, there is no need to discard any water or filtrate 
                    or add any chemical fertilizers, making it both sustainable and environmentally friendly.
                    <br/><br/>
                    While most people know that Aquaponics is the combination of Aquaculture and Hydroponics, 
                    rather fewer know much of how it came about. The notion of using fish wastes to fertilize plants 
                    (the fundamental premise of aquaponics) has its roots in early Asian and South American civilizations.

                    Ecomimicry is the design and production of structures and systems that are modelled on biological 
                    entities and processes. Aquaponic systems are manufactured environments that attempt to replicate a 
                    complex natural system. Every component and process in an aquaponic system has a natural counterpart.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Aquaponics is a system of permaculture. One of the core tenets of permaculture is the “return of surplus” 
                    which is maximizing the efficient use of resources and eliminating waste. Often, waste can be eliminated 
                    simply by recognizing it as a resource and using rather than discarding it.
                    <br/><br/>
                    At Sattvic Aquaponics, we extract five different uses from every kilogram of fish feed and three uses from 
                    every litre of water. The fish feed is used to raise fish, which in turn feed plants via the bacteria. 
                    The resulting fish waste is captured and converted to a fertilizer product.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Basic Requirements:</strong> Electric power, Water, Breathable Atmosphere, 
                    Reasonably closed environment to control the light, airflow, temperature and humidity. 
                    Apparatus to built a aquaponics system.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Components of Aquaponics System:</strong> Fish tank, Solid grow bed of gravel, 
                    More than one feet deep pond for water culture,
                    Submersible pump to release water into grow beds,
                    Aerator to maintain oxygen levels in tank,
                    Testing kit to check pH levels.
                    <br/><hr><br/>
                    <strong>Aquaponic System Cycle</strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    Fish are fed food and produce ammonia rich waste. Too much waste substance is toxic for the fish, 
                    but they can withstand high levels of nitrates.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Dissolved Oxygen enters the system through an air pump. 
                    This Oxygen is essential for plant growth and fish survival.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The bacteria, which are cultured in the grow beds as well as in a fish tank breaks down 
                    the ammonia into nitrites and then nitrates.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Plants take in the converted nitrates as nutrients. The nutrients are fertilizers, feeding the plants. 
                    Also, the plant roots help filter the water for the fish.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Water from the fish tank is pumped to the plants. Again water in the system is filtered through 
                    the grow medium in the grow beds to the fish tanks. The water also contains all the nutrients for the fish.
                    <br/><hr><br/>
                    <strong>Nitrogen Cycle</strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    Fish excrete waste nitrogen as ammonia into the water.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Nitrifying bacteria then convert the ammonia compound to nitrite and then nitrate. 
                    Both ammonia and nitrite are toxic to fish, while nitrate is relatively harmless and is 
                    also the preferred compound of nitrogen for plant uptake.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Nitrogen is not the only element that can be recycled in this manner, Plants are able 
                    to recover other nutrients from the waste water as well. This relieves the environmental 
                    load and increases the water exchange rate, in turn lowering operational costs.

                    <strong>Site Selection</strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    The first order of business is to excavate the site. Have an excavator level the ground 
                    by removing all turf, topsoil and compostable matter, and scrape down to undisturbed, compacted earth. 
                    The area required is a minimum of 10′ larger than your polyhouse on all four sides.
                    <br/><br/>
                    All large rocks, stumps or debris must be fully removed if exposed above this level. 
                    The minimum site requirements for an aquaponics system include access to water, electricity, 
                    and heat (e.g. natural gas, oil, or propane), and enough space to establish all the structures. 
                    The water source does not have to be high volume. Potential incoming water sources include springs, 
                    wells, and public water supplies. In some cases, public water supplies will have to be dechlorinated before use. 
                    A water supply should be tested for the following and other parameters before a 
                    site is finally selected: pH, oxygen, alkalinity, hardness, suspended/dissolved organics, 
                    inorganics (particularly iron and manganese), and pesticides. If a site has a risk of potential ground/surface 
                    water contamination, then it should not be selected.

                    <strong>Polyhouse Design</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The aquaponics system should be housed inside with enough area having gutter-connected 
                    greenhouse with a gravel floor and metal frames. The roof will be constructed using double 
                    layered plastic with different thicknesses of south and north. The wall of the greenhouse 
                    should be built with hollow blocks and glass above to it. 
                    <br><br>
                    If you are buying a new greenhouse, it will come with detailed installation instructions 
                    as well as all required hardware. Follow the instructions to the letter. If you are buying 
                    a used greenhouse, one of the biggest downsides is it is likely that it will not come with 
                    installation instructions. Accordingly, you must either be meticulous in documenting how 
                    the greenhouse is taken down so you can reverse steps to reinstall it, or you should hire 
                    professional installers.

                  FISH PRODUCTION
                </div>
                <div class="card-body">
                  <p class="card-text">
                    There are several species of both warm water and cold water fish that are well adapted to 
                    growing in recirculating aquaponic systems. These include tilapia, catfish, rainbow trout, 
                    perch, carp, Arctic char, goldfish, and largemouth and striped bass. Non-native aquaculture 
                    fish species can be imported and used for the system. Before importing or beginning to culture 
                    any non-native species, an application for importation of exotic species should be made ahead 
                    and accepted by the respective organization.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Koi, an ornamental type of carp, thrive in aquaponics systems. Even though they aren’t 
                    technically edible, they live an incredibly long time and are some of the hardiest fish 
                    you will find. 
                    The major benefit of using koi in an aquaponics system is that they are highly tolerant 
                    of a wide range of temperatures. 
                    Most do best in water that ranges from 35 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit, although they can 
                    survive outside of this range, too. This means you won’t need to heat the water to keep 
                    your fish healthy.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As with any aquaponics fish species, there are disadvantages to selecting koi. One of the 
                    biggest issues is that koi are not typically used as food sources. For most people, the major 
                    draw of an aquaponics system is that it can provide two sources of food: fish and plants 
                    (usually vegetables). However, koi don’t really check off that first box. You may be able 
                    to raise them in your pond for the purpose of selling them to collectors later, but you’ll 
                    reduce the overall potential for harvest from your system.
                    <br><br>
                    The ease of accessing a fish supply will depend greatly upon your location. Seek a hatchery 
                    that is Certified Disease Free by your local fisheries authority and that can provide a Certificate 
                    of Fish Health for fingerlings you purchase. Note that even Certified disease-free hatcheries will 
                    occasionally encounter disease problems, but a good hatchery will remedy these quickly as they arise 
                    and problems, should not be ongoing. The size of the fish you put into your system will largely be 
                    determined by the availability and cost of fingerlings in your area. The amount of time they spend 
                    in the system is determined by their growth rate and target harvest weight.
                    <br><hr><br>
                    <strong>Fish Feed and Nutrition</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Koi are large fish, and they are also long-lived fish. They can live up to thirty years in captivity 
                    and grow more than three feet in length.
                    As your fish grow larger, they are going to need more space to thrive. With that said, it is not recommended 
                    that you start your system off with fully grown, mature fish. Instead, start with small fish. This will let 
                    your fish get acclimated to the system and also keep your aquaponics system healthy and functional.
                    <br><br>
                    Feeding rate for aquaponics is the amount of feed fed to fish daily per square meter of plant surface area. 
                    Size of plant beds and number of plants are directly related to the amount of feed input into the system. 
                    For floating rafts, fish feed in between 60-100 g/day/m2 of plant growing area for the staggered production 
                    of leaf lettuce should be added to the unit. Meaning, every 60 to 100 g of feed supports 1m2 of floating bed 
                    surface area. Fish feed consists of all the nutrients that are required for growth, energy and reproduction. 
                    Dietary requirements are identified for proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, energy, minerals and 
                    vitamins.

                    Many people look at aquaponic systems and all they see is fish and plants. Much is written about 
                    this and many people define aquaponics as the “combination of fish and plants”. The fact is that 
                    there is a third, and equally important, group whose management is often completely  ignored: bacteria.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Bacteria are probably the hardest little workers never be seen or meet or touched by hand. They are the 
                    little microscopic creatures that do all the work in an Aquaponics system converting fish waste into food 
                    so that the plants can absorb. Hundreds and billions of them chugging along, multiplying, eating and dancing 
                    away, unseen in aquaponics water, in the grow-bed, adhering to the underside of old pump, the slime coating 
                    of your fish and onto the fingers hands when the gravel media that make up the aquaponic system is touched.
                    <br/><br/>
                    While there are literally hundreds of types of bacteria that will home into aquaponics systems, Aquaponicists 
                    will often talk about very important ones as they do the job of converting the toxic  ammonia from the fish 
                    into benign nitrate: Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter. They are of a family of autotrophic bacteria called 
                    “nitrifying bacteria”. When an Aquaponics system is constructed and ready to be used for the first time there 
                    will be virtually no beneficial bacteria present, colonies of Nitrosomanas and Nitrobacter must be established 
                    before the system will work correctly. They always oxidise Ammonia to Nitrite and Nitrite to Nitrate.

                    The fish supply needed nutrients to the plants and help to keep the water clean to create a 
                    healthy growing environment. Through the use of grow beds, which can be filled with clay pebbles or 
                    gravel the water continuously flows through and provides a nutrient rich environment for plants.
                    Many plants can be grown in aquaponic systems, and the choice of plants will depend on the stocking 
                    density of the fish being grown because this will influence the concentration of nutrients in the fish 
                    effluent. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Over 300 varieties of aquaponics plants have been tested to see which ones would thrive best in the system. 
                    The huge list of successful plants are basically anything that grows well above soil and love to have their 
                    roots wet. Plants that have low to medium nutrient requirements that are well adapted to aquaponic systems 
                    include lettuce, basil, spinach, chives, herbs, watercress and other leafy green vegetables.
                    <br/><hr><br/>
                    <strong>Growth Cycle</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The growth cycle of a plant will vary depending on the time of the year, primarily due to fluctuations 
                    in photoperiod and air temperature. The two types of production are multistage (transplanted) and direct seeding. <br><br>
                    A typical multistage growth cycle is: <br>
                    - 1 week sprouting in the Germination Chamber. <br>
                    - 3–4 weeks growing first leaves on the Seedling Table. <br>
                    - 3–6 weeks growing to maturity in the troughs. <br>
                    - Note that larger plants are thinned or spaced half way through the trough stage. <br><br>
                    Direct seeding is sowing seeds directly into net pots and inserting 
                    into troughs where they will germinate and grow until harvest. Watercress 
                    and baby kale are grown in this manner because they can reach a harvestable size in 4–6 weeks. 
                    The goal is a dense canopy that can be harvested en-mass. Spacing/ thinning is not required.

                  PEST MANAGEMENT

                    We highly recommend learning and implementing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) protocols. 
                    The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization defines IPM as “the careful consideration 
                    of all available pest control techniques and subsequent integration of appropriate measures 
                    that discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions 
                    to levels that are economically justified and reduce or minimize risks to human health and the 
                    environment. IPM emphasizes the growth of a healthy crop with the least possible disruption to 
                    agro-ecosystems and encourages natural pest control mechanisms.” The first and best lines of 
                    defence against pests and disease are cultural and environmental controls. We cannot overstate 
                    their importance in preventing and minimizing disease and pests.
                    <br/><hr><br/>
                    <strong>Cultural Control</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    The most basic and important cultural control is the daily and weekly plant inspection. 
                    Diseased or pest-infested plants should removed from the facility immediately. Sterilize 
                    your hands after removing plants to prevent the spread of disease. Plant quality and maintenance 
                    is also a cultural control. If a particular plant type does not do well in your system, do not 
                    grow it. In an aquaponic farm, the plant must match the system, not vice versa. Every week you 
                    will germinate more seeds than you will require, for one primary reason: so that you always have 
                    healthy, strong, vigorous seedlings to transplant into the troughs. Do not transplant weak 
                    seedlings. Thinning and/ or spacing plants so they are not crowded, stressed and stretching for 
                    light helps to keep plants strong.
                    <br/><br/>
                    While most people know that Aquaponics is the combination of Aquaculture and Hydroponics, 
                    rather fewer know much of how it came about. The notion of using fish wastes to fertilize plants 
                    (the fundamental premise of aquaponics) has its roots in early Asian and South American civilizations.
                    <br><hr><br>
                    <strong>Environmental Control</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Environmental controls are the conditions of your greenhouse: air and water temperature, 
                    humidity, light level and air movement. In order to have strong plants, you must have a 
                    good environment.
                    <br><br>
                    In cold seasons, use circulation fans to equalize temperature and humidity throughout the greenhouse. 
                    In warm seasons, these fans should be turned off to allow the air to stratify. With the fans off, warm 
                    air will rise to the roof where it can be vented out, drawing cooler air in through the doors and roll-up sides. 
                    For optimum plant growth, humidity should be 50–80% year-round. Hygrometers are inexpensive and commonly available. 
                    Place them near the plant canopy in various locations as well as outside.
                    <br><hr><br>
                    <strong>Sticky Traps</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Sticky traps are cheap, bright yellow paper cards covered in a sticky resin that are very useful in helping 
                    to identify early stages of pest infestation. We recommend hanging them just above the canopy at random 
                    locations to identify when and where a pest population is growing, by observing the concentration of trapped 
                    insects on each card.
                    <br><hr><br>
                    <strong>Beneficial Insects</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    This form of “bio-control” consists of adding and raising populations of beneficial insects 
                    (lady bugs, aphidius wasps, etc) to feed on bugs that eat the plants. A packet of beneficial Nematodes, 
                    tiny microscopic organisms which are effective in killing bugs but completely safe for people, pets, and 
                    the environment can be used. Lady bugs can devour up to 50 aphids, mealy bugs, scale, leaf hoppers, or other 
                    destructive pests per day.
